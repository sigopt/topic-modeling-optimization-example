```
install.packages("parallel")
install.packages("textmineR"")
install.packages("randomForest")
install.packages("magrittr")

```

You will also have to run this code from the root folder by doing one of the follwing:

1. From the command line: enter your R environment from the root directory of the folder
2. From any start point: run `setwd("X")` where `"X"` is the root folder of this repo.
3. Use RStudio and open the project "topic-modeing-optimization-example.Rproj" from your RStudio IDE. This will handle all working diretory issues.
